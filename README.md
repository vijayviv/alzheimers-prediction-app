## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Predicts Alzheimer's vs. Normal condition using MRI-derived features
- Uses PCA and Ensemble Learning (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit
- Real-time predictions from uploaded patient data

---

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Ensemble models: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression

ðŸ“¦ Dataset Information
This model was initially trained on a small sample of 100 data points for testing and prototyping purposes.

The full dataset is included in the /data/ folder (full_dataset.csv) for further training, validation, or benchmarking.

You are encouraged to retrain or fine-tune the model using the complete dataset for better performance and generalization
